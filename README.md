# Jean-Heude

**J.E.A.N-H.E.U.D.E** is an AI orchestrator designed to be **100% local** and **fully open-source**.

By leveraging cutting-edge community projects, it provides a sovereign AI experience without compromising on privacy or performance.

# 🚀 Key Features

- **Total Sovereignty:** 100% local execution—your data never leaves your machine.
    
- **Agentic Reasoning:** Real-time "Thinking" process visualization, allowing you to follow the AI's logic step-by-step (inspired by o1/DeepSeek-R1).
    
- **Ultra-Smooth Voice Interaction:** High-performance audio delivery using **raw PCM bitstreaming** for near-zero latency.
    
- **Tool Integration (MCP):** Powered by the **Model Context Protocol**, Jean-Heude can browse the web, check your files, or fetch real-time data.
    
- **Unified Memory:** Integration with **Mem0** and **Qdrant**, giving the AI persistent, long-term memory across all your sessions.
    
- **Dynamic Orchestration:** Automatically selects the best local model from your pool based on the complexity of your request.

# 🎙️ Innovation: PCM Bitstreaming vs. WAV

Unlike traditional systems that generate a full **WAV** file (requiring the user to wait for the end of generation or deal with complex header stitching), Jean-Heude now utilizes **raw 16-bit PCM bitstreaming**:

- **Zero Wait Latency:** Audio starts playing the moment the first few bytes are generated by the TTS engine, without waiting for a file container to close.
    
- **Intelligent Sequencing:** Implements a Frontend **Promise Chain** to queue audio IDs. This ensures sentences flow naturally into one another without gaps, overlaps, or "robotic" pauses.
    
- **Bit-Perfect Stability:** Advanced handling of **leftover bytes** ensures that 16-bit samples split across network packets are reconstructed perfectly, eliminating digital "clicks" or "pops."

# 🛠 Technical Stack

The architecture is split into specialized layers for maximum efficiency:

- **Frontend:** **SvelteKit** (Svelte 5) utilizing the **AudioContext API** for real-time binary stream rendering.
    
- **Backend:** **Python (FastAPI)** handling core agentic logic, memory cleanup, and tool orchestration.
    
- **Voice Engine:** **Kokoro-ONNX** for ultra-fast, high-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS).
    
- **Memory Layer:** **Mem0** + **Qdrant** (running via Docker) for vector storage and semantic search.
    
- **Inference Engine:** **Ollama**, serving both Large Language Models (LLMs) and Embedding models.

# 📦 Infrastructure Requirements

To get Jean-Heude up and running, you will need:

1. **Ollama:** To manage and run your local models (e.g., Qwen, Llama, Phi).
    
2. **Docker:** Specifically to host the **Qdrant** server for vector storage.
    
3. **Voice Models:** `kokoro-v1.0.onnx` and `voices-v1.0.bin` files placed in the `model/tts/` directory.
    
4. **Python 3.12+** and **Node.js 20+**.
